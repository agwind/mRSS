mRSS - a RSS reader

This is a simple web RSS reader that you can host your self.

I'm using this app everyday, but I'm also using it as a platform for experimentation.  Some features may be a little rough around the edges.  Currently things like subscriptions must be added manually.  The current components are as follows (subject to change):

* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) 
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [Dancer](http://perldancer.org/)
* [Xslate](http://xslate.org/)
* [Moose](https://metacpan.org/pod/Moose)
* [DBIx::Class](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx::Class)  

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for instructions to install and configure this software.
